<h1>Going Back To Basics</h1>

<p>An unusual tip this time, but bear with me...</p>

<p>Whatever language you tend to program in, you probably use an editor or development environment that has fancy features like autocomplete, function name suggestions, etc. This week's tip is to try programming without them. Either switch them off if you're able, or use a basic text editor with no such helpful features.</p>

<p>"Why would you do that?", I hear you ask. There are a few benefits which may help you later in your programming career.</p>

<p>Firstly, you'll likely find you're seeing more errors due to things like missing parentheses or end-of-line semi-colons. Although it's frustrating at first, this teaches you the effect of these small mistakes so you can learn to recognize them in future.</p>

<p>Secondly, it's always good to be prepared for unexpected situations such as having to use a different or limited environment in future. This could be because of a project requirement or even a coding interview for a job. The less time you spend stressing about the lack of helpful features, the more you can concentrate on the code itself.</p>

<p>Finally, you should find you gain a general deeper understanding of the language. This is never a bad thing, and you might even see it in a new light and discover new ways of using it.</p>

<p>So there you go! Switch off the fancy features and try getting back to basics for a while.</p>
