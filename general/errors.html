<h1>Deliberately Make Errors</h1>

<p>I'm going to follow the trend of the past two weeks and make the "back-to-basics" tips a trilogy!</p>

<p>When you're learning a programming language, it's common to copy and execute chunks of code from a book or tutorial, but inevitably they sometimes fail. Because the language is new, it's difficult to find the problem quickly and the error messages often don't help, so before you get stuck, here's something to try...</p>

<p><em>Deliberately make errors</em></p>

<p>That's right &mdash; I want you to put bugs in your code on purpose! When you do, check the resulting error message and make a note of it. For example, you could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a variable without declaring it.</li>
  <li>Use the wrong number of arguments for a function.</li>
  <li>Remove a character such as a parenthesis or semi-colon.</li>
  <li>Spell important words wrong in various parts of the code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeat this a few times and you'll soon learn what causes common error messages, meaning that when they appear "for real" it should be much faster for you to find and fix the problem.</p>

<p>You could even use it as an excuse if you mess up in future: "Oh yeah, that bug is supposed to be there!"</p>
