<h1>EditorConfig</h1>

<p>This week's tip is relevant for developers in any language and is helpful for maintaining a consistent coding style. It's a project called <a href="http://editorconfig.org/">EditorConfig</a> which effectively tells your editor or IDE how to format your code.</p>

<p>It's an elegant concept â€” simply a config file with a few specifications, such as using tabs or spaces for indentation, or using a particular character set. The clever part is that you can use more than one config file, meaning you can have separate styles for work and personal projects. Some <a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/Projects-Using-EditorConfig">open source projects</a> even suppy their own config files (perhaps something we should consider for DuckDuckHack?).</p>

<p>To use it, you may need to install a plugin so you should check the <a href="http://editorconfig.org/#download">editor list on the official website</a>. After that, you simply add a <code>.editorconfig</code> file in a project directory, or in the parent directory of all your code projects. The <code>.editorconfig</code> files are just text files and very easy to customize. Definitely worth giving a try to ensure consistency.</p>
