<p>An unusual tip this week because it's more of a "did you know?" message. Here's the background...</p>

<p>Imagine you're a web developer, you've created a new web app or site, and you get reports that there's a problem in a particular browser or device. It's reproducible but you just can't work out why it's happening. It's time to call <a href="https://webcompat.com/">WebCompat</a>!</p>

<p>They'll help you with <strong>browser compatibility bugs</strong> by following this process listed on their website:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Report a bug for any website or browser</li>
  <li>Our team of volunteers diagnoses the bug</li>
  <li>We send a fix to the site owner or browser</li>
</ol>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/webcompat">open source project</a> is run by a mixture of Mozilla staff and volunteers, but bugs need not be restricted to Mozilla browsers. It truly is an effort to improve the web by spreading awareness of and fixes for browser quirks and poor single-browser coding habits. Their only request is that web developers don't abuse the system, and so they have a <a href="https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/wiki/Invalid-Bugs">handy list of invalid bugs</a> which you should check before submitting an issue.</p> 

<p>All that's left for you to do is say thank you, and perhaps give them a shout out <a href="https://twitter.com/webcompat">on Twitter</a>.</p>
