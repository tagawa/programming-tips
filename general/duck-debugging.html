<h1>Rubber Duck Debugging</h1>

<p>Like <a href="https://duck.co/blog/post/325/weekly-update-116-focus-on-javascript#tip">last week's "back to basics" tip</a>, this week we're going to simplify things but specifically for debugging. I'd like to tell you about a low-tech technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>. It's not related to DuckDuckGo but it gets our seal of approval!</p>

<p>So here's how it works... When there's a bug in your code but you can't find it, you explain what your code does to a rubber duck, line by line. This forces you to break down your code into basic chunks, re-thinking what each chunk is for, and hopefully discovering the problem. It's surprising how often this kind of simplification makes you look at what you've written from a different perspective, seeing things you hadn't noticed before.</p>

<p>Of course, you could do this with any object but we think ducks work best!</p>
