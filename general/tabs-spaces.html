<h1>Tabs vs. Spaces</h1>

<p>You may have seen the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tabs+versus+spaces+silicon+valley&ia=videos&iai=SsoOG6ZeyUI">tabs vs spaces Silicon Valley episode</a> — definitely worth watching — but whatever side of the debate you're on, we shouldn't underestimate the importance of indentation when programming.</p>

<p>Even with modern editors there are times when the auto-indentation doesn't work properly so this week's tip is to always take the time to press that tab/space key to make your lines indent correctly and consistently. Not only does it look professional, it's incredibly helpful when skimming code and essential when debugging.</p>

<p>Some languages require indentation, for example Python. Others such as HTML don't care but you should still indent properly, especially in today's world of divs within divs within divs within... you get the idea!</p>

<p>And a final reminder that it's also important to respect the indentation style of the project you're working on — see <a href="https://duck.co/blog/post/336/weekly-update-123-java-moving-forward#tip">last week's tip</a> for help with that.</p>
