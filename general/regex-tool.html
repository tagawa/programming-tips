<h1>A Recommended Regex Tool</h1>

<p>It's another one from our resident human knowledgebase, Zaahir ([@moollaza](https://github.com/moollaza)). As you know, our Instant Answers use a lot of regular expressions, just like many other projects, but they can be frustrating to set up and to debug. This tool makes things a lot easier:</p>

<p>In the first box you build your regular expression, and as you enter characters it dynamically shows a helpful visualization above, allowing you to see the effect each character has. For example, adding "?" to indicate an optional item would automatically draw a new line showing that the parser can bypass the preceding character(s).</p>

<p>This may sound complicated but thankfully there's also a second box for testing particular strings. Whatever you enter in that box will be highlighted if there's a partial or full match.</p>

<p>It's hard to describe properly so I recommend you take a look and play with some basic regex to see the result.</p>
