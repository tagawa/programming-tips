<h1>Variable &amp; Function Naming</h1>

<p>This is more good practice than a tip, but worth a reminder anyway. Whether beginner or expert, it's sensible to name your variables and functions descriptively. This may seem obvious but a lot of code, for example when looking at the source code of web applications, has very short variable names, sometimes just a single letter. This is because the code has been passed through a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=js+minifier&ia=answer">minifier</a>, making it smaller in size but also harder to read. Don't copy names from this code!</p>

<p>Instead, decide on a naming convention that makes your code readable by humans, whether that's your colleagues, open source contributors, or even you in a few years time. Two rules that have helped me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start function names with a verb</li>
  <li>Start booleans with "is" or "has"</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, examples of easy-to-understand function names include <code>showMessage</code> or <code>startTimer</code>. Examples of clear boolean variable names include <code>isActive</code> or <code>hasContent</code>. These are all very readable and make it obvious what the code does.</p>

<p>Like many areas of programming, there are different opinions about naming conventions but this is a good starting point and definitely better than using abbreviations or inconsistent terms.</p>
