<h1>Programming Resources</h1>

<p>This week's tip is simple and you may have seen us tweet about it at [@DuckDuckHack](https://twitter.com/duckduckhack). Whether you're learning the basics or trying to polish your skills, there's a wonderful crowd-sourced list of programming books and other resources &mdash; hundreds of them, all available for free:</p>

<p>And yes, that's legally free â˜º</p>

<p>The list is divided into nearly 200(!) categories and also offers links to online courses and interactive tutorials. On top of that, there are lists of programming resources in 23 non-English languages.</p>

<p>Thanks to Zaahir (<a href="https://github.com/moollaza">moollaza</a>) for sharing this, and I encourage you to send suggestions to that repository if you know of more good free programming resources.</p>
