<h1>Use Strict</h1>

<p>We've been neglecting JavaScripters so let's put that right. An easy but important tip to improve your JavaScript code is to add this line:</p>

<p><code>'use strict';</code></p>

<p>either at the top of your whole script (my recommendation) or within a function.</p>

<p>As you can probably work out, it tells the browser or JavaScript parser to be strict with your code. As a result, it will complain if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declare variables without <code>var</code></li>
  <li>Use <code>eval()</code> inappropriately</li>
  <li>Use reserved words as variable names</li>
  <li>Use the <code>with</code> keyword</li>
</ul>

<p>These, and a few other advantages, will make your code more secure and help you develop better coding practices. In addition, because it's just a string, it will be ignored by browsers that don't understand it, so you don't need to worry about backwards-compatibility issues. A double win!</p>

<p>And as a bonus, it can be used in Perl too, although the syntax is slightly different:</p>

<p><code>use string;</code></p>

<p>Whichever language, I recommend you use this in all your code unless you have a very good reason not to.</p>
