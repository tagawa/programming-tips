<h1>JavaScript Linters</h1>

<p>Continuing with the JavaScript theme from last week, here are a couple of similar tools that should improve your code, especially if you use them repeatedly over a period of time. They're both called linters and tell you which parts of your code are not following best practices, even if the code actually works.</p>

<h4><a href="http://jslint.com/">JSLint</a></h4>

<p>JSLint, created by Doug Crockford, is the original and comes with a warning that it "will hurt your feelings"! Even so, give it a try and be sure to take a look at the options, for example the check for code meant for a browser.</p>

<h4><a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a></h4>

<p>This is similar but seems to be more flexible, and can be customized to suit you or your team's coding guidelines. Like JSLint, this, too, can hurt your feelings but it's well worth it!</p>

<p>Lint originally means the fluff you find in the bottom of your pockets, and these tools are great for helping you remove the unnecessary fluff from your code.</p>
