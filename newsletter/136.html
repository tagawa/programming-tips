							<h1>Weekly Update 136: Some re-organization</h1>

                            <p>Hello contributors,</p>

                            <p>How's your 2017 going? Since the January newsletter we've been trying to make some organizational improvements. Firstly, we archived the forum at duck.co/forum which included an Instant Answers ideas section. This means that all developer discussion can be fully focused on <a href="https://forum.duckduckhack.com/">forum.duckduckhack.com</a>. We also archived the blog at duck.co/blog which contains these developer newsletters — 135 of them! Future developer updates will also be posted to <a href="https://forum.duckduckhack.com/">forum.duckduckhack.com</a>. A benefit of this is better spam control, which was a growing problem and tackled single-handedly by Community Leader x-15a2's non-stop efforts.</p>

                            <p>By the way, for non-developer discussion we'll continue to use the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo subreddit</a>, and for blog posts we have a new privacy-centric blog: <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/">spreadprivacy.com</a></p>

                            <p>One more area that is sometimes overlooked is the variety of <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/">GitHub repositories</a> we have. Did you know a large number of our web pages, as well as apps and extensions, are open source and hosted on GitHub? If you find something that should be improved, please feel free to file an issue or even send a pull request.</p>

                            <p>Of course, the DuckDuckHack community is centered around the Instant Answer "zeroclickinfo" repos, and they're still the best way for people to join the community and contribute code that makes an impact and reaches potentially millions of users. Recently PJHampton has compiled a <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/issues/747">meta issue of the most high-value tasks</a>, but in the meantime here's a quick summary of some we're looking for help with...</p>

						<h3>5-minute-ish Fixes</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/issues/733">Ruby: List all topic titles and language features to help measure coverage</a>
                            <p>This just involves creating a "cover" directory containing text files that list all the topic titles and language features to cover.</p></li>

                            <li><a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues/3129">Currency Conversion: Trigger more for bitcoin queries</a>
                            <p>There are queries such as "bitcoin price" and "bitcoin value" where we should be showing this IA.</p></li>

                            <li><a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues/3079">Bitcoin Addresses, Blocks</a>
                            <p>The "More at..." link is not working. This should be a simple fix to update it.</p></li>

						<h3>Quick Tip</h3>

                        <p>A security tip this time, important for anyone who searches for code to use on the command line (all of us?!). Graduate student Suresh Alse has an elegant but scary demo showing how risky copying and pasting commands is. Sure, we already know to fully understand what commands to before pressing Enter, but there's another risk — hidden code.</p>

                        <p>His demo uses CSS to hide code within a simple <code>ls -lat</code> command. It looks innocent but demonstrates that when you select and copy that code from his website, any text hidden with CSS will also be copied and consequently executed. Fortunately his example is harmless but scary nevertheless. Definitely worth trying out:</p>

                        <p><a href="https://lifepluslinux.blogspot.jp/2017/01/look-before-you-paste-from-website-to.html">lifepluslinux.blogspot.jp/2017/01/look-before-you-paste-from-website-to.html</a></p>

                        <p>So how do we protect ourselves from such an attack? There are a couple of options:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Look at the command and then type it out the command manually</li>
                            <li>Copy the command and paste it into a text editor to double-check the contents</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It may seem like extra effort but worth it to learn more about the commands you're executing.</p>

                            <p>As mentioned last time, we're now publishing this newsletter less frequently, probably about once a month. If there's particular content you'd like to see or tips you want to share, please reply to this email or let us know on <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckhack">Twitter</a>.</p>

                            <p>That's all for now — stay safe everyone!</p>
