							<h1>Weekly Update 134: Happy New Year!</h1>

                            <p>Hello contributors,</p>

                            <p>I hope you had a great start to the new year. 2016 was a year full of activity and achievements for DuckDuckHack so I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the highlights of the past 12 months.</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>We started the year with a global Quack & Hack event, bringing together contributors from around the world both online and offline, and with new <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/duckduckhack">explanatory videos</a>. Read the <a href="https://duck.co/blog/post/243/global-quack-hack-2-report">post-event report here</a>.</li>
                              <li>We started a contributor list for easier community management and to enable people to have the DDG badge on their GitHub profile. You can <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/issues/182">request an invite here</a>.</li>
                              <li>The <a href="https://duckduckhack.com">DuckDuckHack website</a> got a nice refresh including a consolidated <a href="https://duckduckhack.com/issues">list of open issues</a> as well as individual contributor profile pages such as <a href="https://duckduckhack.com/u/tagawa/">this one</a>.</li>
                              <li>For the first time we focused on a single topic — a <a href="https://duck.co/blog/post/327/duckduckgo-friends-newsletter-70">Programming Mission</a> — to channel the efforts of the whole community to improve searches for developers. This has resulted in an increase in quality of code contributions, a lot of great feedback from users and we now have over <a href="https://duck.co/ia?topic=programming">300 programming Instant Answers</a>.</li>
                              <li>To support the Programming Mission there's now a <a href="https://forum.duckduckhack.com/">DuckDuckHack forum</a> for discussing Instant Answer (IA) ideas and improvements, as well as automated data on IA usage.</li>
                              <li>And to finish off with a couple more statistics, we finished the year with over 2,100 members in our <a href="https://duckduckhack.slack.com">Slack team</a> (you can <a href="https://quackslack.herokuapp.com/">join here</a>) and we passed 10,000 followers of the <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckhack">DuckDuckHack Twitter account</a>.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>But the thing that brings the biggest smile to my face is seeing the community thrive with enthusiastic new contributors, dedicated long-time contributors, helpful community leaders, and proactive language leaders. Thanks to your hard work we have a community that is friendly, creative and passionate about open source and privacy. Both individually and as a team, it's a pleasure to chat, plan and code with you and I look forward to what 2017 brings. Thank you all!</p>

                            <p>As usual, let's continue with a look at a few of the Instant Answer issues we're looking for help with...</p>

						<h3>Quick Tip</h3>

                        <p>Here's a quick command line tip from developer Remy Sharp taken from his new book, <a href="https://remysharp.com/2016/12/09/working-the-command-line">Working the Command Line</a>. It involves something called a <em>pling dollar</em> which is simply <code>!$</code> and represents the last command line argument you entered. This could be useful when you're executing multiple related commands, but it's best explained with an example.</p>

                        <p>Let's say you're converting a video file into a new format, e.g. with <code>ffmpeg</code>:</p>

                        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.webm</code></pre>

                        <p>The final argument in this case is the name of the output file, so if you wanted to copy that file into a directory named "backup", you could use <code>!$</code> instead of having to re-type the filename:</p>

                        <pre><code>cp !$ backup</code></pre>

                        <p>Not only does this save a bit of time, it also reduces the chance of typing errors — a double win!</p>
