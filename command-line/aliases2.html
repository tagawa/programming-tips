<h1>More Ideas for Aliases</h1>

<p>Last week we saw how aliases could be used as an autocorrect for command line typing mistakes. This week, a few other ideas for how to use aliases, primarily to save time typing or to avoid having to remember long commands.</p>

<p>We tend to use a handful of Git commands again and again, so how about shortening them?</p>

<p><code>`alias gitc = "git checkout"`</code></p>

<p><code>`alias gitcm = "git checkout master"`</code></p>

<p><code>`alias gits = "git status -sb"`</code></p>

<p>Is there a directory you often move to? Try creating a single-letter alias for super-fast directory changing:</p>

<p><code>`alias c = "cd /usr/local/ddg.cache/share/spice"`</code></p>

<p>And aliases don't have to be letters. You could create aliases to cut out the command names altogether, like these directory changing shortcuts:</p>

<p><code>`alias .. = "cd .."`</code></p>

<p><code>`alias ... = "cd ../.."`</code></p>

<p>And so on...</p>

<p>Even if you don't use these exact aliases, hopefully they provide inspiration for you to create your own. Remember, these aliases should be added to the .bash_profile or .bashrc file in your home directory, and then restart the terminal for them to take effect.</p>
