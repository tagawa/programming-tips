<h1>Command Line Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>

<p>We all love keyboard shortcuts, right? And we all use the command line, right? So what better than telling you all the keyboard shortcuts available for the command line!</p>

<p>This is super easy &mdash; just type this command:</p>

<p><code>bind -p</code></p>

<p>You'll then see a long list of all the keyboard shortcuts set up for your terminal. It may look confusing at first but <code>\C</code> means the Control key and <code>\e</code> means the escape key. Shortcuts with a hyphen mean you should hold down the keys simultaneously, and with no hyphen it means press the keys consecutively.</p>

<p>A simple tip, but you may find a shortcut that could save you lots of time. Note that this may not work on Windows unless you use something like MinGW/msys.</p>
