<h1>Repeating Commands</h1>

<p>A quick and easy one this week. Sometimes at the command line you want to repeat your last command. Well, there's a command for that:</p>

<p><code>`!!`</code></p>

<p>Perhaps not so useful on its own, but how many times have you had to repeat a command and append `sudo` to the front? Now it's easy:</p>

<p><code>`sudo !!`</code></p>

<p>Perhaps it works with sandwiches too: <a href="https://xkcd.com/149/">xkcd.com/149</a></p>
