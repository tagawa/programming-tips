<h1>How To Use Aliases</h1>

<p>Similar to last week, this is a useful trick to fix command line spelling mistakes courtesy of my colleague, John. He uses aliases to cover various spellings of commands, for example when typing quickly we could accidentally type `git` as `gti`, `igt`, `got`, etc.</p>

<p>Aliases are usually created within a .bashrc or .bash_profile file, found in the home directory on Linux and Mac. In that file, simply asign commands to aliases as follows, with one alias per line:</p>

<p><code>`alias gti="git"`</code></p>

<p><code>`alias igt="git"`</code></p>

<p><code>`alias got="git"`</code></p>

<p>In this example, typing `gti status` would actually execute `git status`. Pretty handy, huh? You need to restart the terminal for it to take effect, and then you're free to type as fast as you can, knowing that the computer will forgive any typos!</p>
