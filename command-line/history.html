<h1>Searching Command Line History</h1>

<p>I discovered this a while ago and have found myself using it again and again.</p>

<p>You can quickly search previous entries in your command line history using [Ctrl] + [R] - yes, on a Mac it's still [Ctrl] and not [Command].</p>

<p>This is particularly useful with commands you only use occasionally. For example, I keep forgetting the parameter order for adding a remote upstream Git repository. Was it `git add remote upstream [repo]`? Typing [Ctrl] + [R] followed by `remote` brings up the last time I used that command, and it shows me the correct syntax is actually `git remote add upstream [repo]`.</p>

<p>You can then press [Enter] to run that command again, [Escape] to edit the command before running, or the down arrow to go back to an empty command line. Handy, huh?</p>
