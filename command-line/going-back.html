<h1>Moving Backwards</h1>

<p>Here's a handy tip from my colleague, Jag. A hyphen can represent a previous location, and can be used to move quickly and save time. This works both on the command line and in Git. Let's see a couple of examples:</p>

<h2>Command line</h2>

<p>Let's say I'm in my home directory, e.g. /home/daniel, and I move to /usr/local:</p>

<p><code>`cd /usr/local`</code></p>

<p>Now if I want to move back to my home directory, I just type:</p>

<p><code>`cd -`</code></p>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>Moving between git branches is the same. Let's say I'm on the master branch and I want to change to a different one for editing:</p>

<p><code>`git checkout my-edits`</code></p>

<p>To get back to master I can simply type:</p>

<p><code>`git checkout -`</code></p>

<p>Think of all the keystrokes you can save over the years!</p>
