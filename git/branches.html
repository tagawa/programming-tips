<h1>Using Git Branches</h1>

<p>We're staying with Git this week, and it's a basic but very valuable tip:</p>

<p><strong>Always do your coding on a branch that is NOT master.</strong></p>

<p>It sounds simple but will save a lot of confusion if you stick to it. Branches can be thought of as workspaces and as they're usually created from the master branch, it's important to keep that one clean and up-to-date. You'd then use a separate branch when working on a particular task, e.g. for making a new Instant Answer, you could create a branch like so:</p>

<p><code>`git checkout -b my-new-ia`</code></p>

<p>That way, your edits will not clash with other people's work and if necessary, you can simply delete the branch and create a new one should things go wrong.</p>
