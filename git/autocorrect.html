<h1>Git Autocorrect</h1>

<p>It's easy to make spelling mistakes when typing commands, but did you know Git has a feature to automatically correct such mistakes (typos)? Autocorrect is one of Git's built-in options and can be enabled with this command:</p>

<p><code>`git config --global help.autocorrect 1`</code></p>

<p>Then you're ready to go! Let's see it in action with an incorrect spelling:</p>

<p><code>`git chekout master`</code></p>

<p>With autocorrect enabled, this incorrect command will still be recognized and executed. A handy option meaning less re-typing.</p>
