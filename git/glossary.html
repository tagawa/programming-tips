<h1>Git Glossary</h1>

<p>Do you ever find yourself using Git and suddenly getting a message you don't understand? Perhaps it's filled with Git terms like "fast-forward", "rebase", "HEAD", and so on. You could <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">search the web</a> of course, but did you know Git has a built in glossary? You don't even have to leave the terminal â€” just type in this command:</p>

<p><code>git help glossary</code></p>

<p>Thankfully the explanations are all written clearly and are easy to understand. Use the spacebar to quickly browse through all the terms, and when you've found the information you're looking for, just press <kbd>q</kbd> to go back to the command prompt.</p>

<p>There are actually several built-in Git help commands like this. For the whole list, type:</p>

<p><code>git help -g</code></p>

<p>Hopefully this helps you out when you get stuck, and if you have a similar programming tip you'd like to share, please let us know at <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckhack">@duckduckhack</a>.</p>
