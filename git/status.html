<h1>The Importance Of Git Status</h1>

<p>This one's short but important.</p>

<p>When working with Git, try using the command <code>git status</code> before you do anything else. This will give an extra reminder of which branch you're on, as well as alert you to any rogue file changes that may need sorting out. This single command has saved me many potential merge conflicts and other headaches since discovering it!</p>
